This is the source code for the paper [Automatic Commit Message Generation: A
Critical Review and Directions for Future Work].

## Project Description

This code is the source code of our paper, which reproduces three models that can automatically generate commit messages: NNgen,CoRec and FIRA. We tested these models with the dataset we constructed. Please refer to our paper for the experiment process and results.

Datasets are provided, which can be used to test the implemented algorithm. For more information, please see the "Dataset" section below.
