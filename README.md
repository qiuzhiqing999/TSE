# Project Name

This is the source code for the paper [Automatic Commit Message Generation: A
Critical Review and Directions for Future Work].

## Project Description
This is the source code of our paper, including the script for  dataset construction and data processing, as well as the code for reproducing five models: NNgen, CoRec, FIRA, CCRep, UniXcoder, and the code for generating commit messages using ChatGPT. We tested these models with the dataset we constructed. Please refer to our paper for the experiment process and results.

Datasets are provided, which can be used to test the implemented algorithm. For more information, please see the "Dataset" section below.
